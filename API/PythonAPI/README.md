# Voice Assistant API Project

This project is part of my personal portfolio to demonstrate how a modular voice assistant system can be built using modern AI tools and clean API design.
The system is designed with a microservice structure ‚Äî each service can run independently and handle its own responsibility.

## üéØ Overview

The Voice Assistant API allows users to speak commands that are automatically transcribed and converted into structured actions.
For example:
- "home" ‚Üí `{ "command_type": "navigate", "value": "home" }`
- "name yanuar email yanuar at gmail dot com" ‚Üí `{ "command_type": "fill_form", "value": { ... } }`

## üß© Current Services

| Service                     | Description                                                                                               | Folder                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Transcriber Services**    | Converts voice or audio files into text using OpenAI Whisper (or Faster-Whisper).                         | `/TranscriberServices`   |
| **Command Parser Services** | Converts plain text (from the transcriber) into structured JSON commands via AI model (Cohere or Ollama). | `/CommandParserServices` |

Each service is self-contained, using its own FastAPI app, models, and utilities.
Both can be tested independently in local environments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- Language: Python 3.10+
- Framework: FastAPI
- AI Models: Whisper (for speech-to-text), Cohere (for text understanding)
- Architecture: Modular microservices
- Documentation: OpenAPI (auto-generated via FastAPI /docs endpoint)

## üß† Project Flow

1. Transcriber ‚Üí Converts audio into text
1. Command Parser ‚Üí Converts that text into structured JSON commands
1. Future Integration (planned) ‚Üí UI Agent or Frontend app executes those commands
